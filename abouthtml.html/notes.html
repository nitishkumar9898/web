HTML
------------
Hyper text markup language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
HTML files are saved with .html format
html files will run with browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.

    <p> para content </p>

    2. unpaired tags
-> only open : <opentag>
    -> only close : </closetag>
    ->self close : <selfclose />

html file starts with htnl tag and ends with html tag.
<html>

</html>

html divided into two sections
1. head section
2. body section
<html>
    
<head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>       
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>





Headings (Paired Tags)
--------------- 
in html heading are h1..h6  
h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest heading.

heading is bold in style.

Paragraphs (Paired Tags)
---------------
In HTML, paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag. Paragraphs are used to separate blocks of text and improve readability.

    List items
----------------        
HTML supports both ordered and unordered lists. Ordered lists are created with the <ol> tag, while unordered lists use the <ul> tag. Each list item is defined with the <li> tag.
1. Ordered List
<OL>

    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</OL>
    Links
---------------
In HTML, links are defined with the <a> tag. The <a> tag has an href attribute that specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

    Images
---------------
In HTML, images are defined with the <img> tag. The <img> tag has a src attribute that specifies the path to the image file.

    Tables
---------------
HTML tables are defined with the <table> tag. Tables consist of rows (<tr>) and cells (<td> for data cells, <th> for header cells). 

    Forms   
---------------
HTML forms are used to collect user input. Forms are defined with the <form> tag and can include various input types such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.

    Semantic HTML
---------------
Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup that conveys meaning about the content. This includes using tags like <article>, <section>, <nav>, and <footer> to structure the document in a way that is meaningful to both browsers and developers.

    Comments
---------------
In HTML, comments are added using the <!-- comment --> syntax. Comments are not displayed in the browser and are used to leave notes or explanations in the code.

    Doctype Declaration
---------------
The doctype declaration is the first line in an HTML document and tells the browser which version of HTML the page is written in. For HTML5, it is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.

    Character Encoding
---------------
Character encoding specifies how characters are represented in the document. The most common encoding is UTF-8, which can be specified in the head section using the <meta> tag:
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

    Meta Tags
---------------
Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document, such as the character set, author, and description. They are placed in the head section and are not displayed in the browser. For example:
```html
<meta name="description" content="This is a sample HTML document.">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="Your Name">
```

    Block-level and Inline Elements
--------------- 
In HTML, elements can be categorized as block-level or inline. Block-level elements (like <div>, <p>, and <h1>) take up the full width available and start on a new line, while inline elements (like <span>, <a>, and <img>) only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.

    Accessibility
---------------
Accessibility in HTML refers to designing web content that is usable by people with disabilities. This includes using semantic HTML, providing alt text for images, and ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

    Responsive Design   
---------------
Responsive design in HTML involves using techniques like fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to ensure that web content looks good on all devices, from desktops to smartphones. This is often achieved with CSS, but HTML structure plays a crucial role in making content adaptable.

    Conclusion
---------------
In conclusion, HTML is a fundamental technology for creating web pages. Understanding its structure, elements, and best practices is essential for building accessible, responsive, and well-structured websites.
